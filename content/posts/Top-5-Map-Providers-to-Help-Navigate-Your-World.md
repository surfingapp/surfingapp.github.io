6. Customizable Map Styling: Personalize the appearance of maps to match specific branding or design requirements, including custom markers, overlays, and map styles.

#### Integration Example

Integrating Google Maps into your website is straightforward with a simple HTML and JavaScript code snippet. First, include the Google Maps JavaScript API script in your HTML file, making sure to replace YOUR\_API\_KEY with your own API key obtained from the Google Cloud Console:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <title>Google Maps Integration Example</title>
  <script async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&callback=initMap"></script>
  <style>
    #map {
      height: 400px;
      width: 100%;
    }
  </style>
</head>

<body>
  <div id="map"></div>
  <script>
    function initMap() {
      const mapCenter = {lat: -34.397, lng: 150.644};
      const map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {
        zoom: 10,
        center: mapCenter
      });
      const marker = new google.maps.Marker({
        position: mapCenter,
        map: map,
        title: 'Hello, World!'
      });
    }
  </script>
</body>

</html>
```

In this example, a div element with the ID map serves as a container for the map. The initMap function initializes the map, sets the center coordinates, and creates a marker at that location. The Google Maps JavaScript API script is loaded asynchronously, and the initMap function is called as the callback once the API is fully loaded.

<html>

<head>
  <title>OpenStreetMap Integration Example</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.css" />
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.js"></script>
  <style>
    #map {
      height: 400px;
      width: 100%;
    }
  </style>
</head>

<body>
  <div id="map"></div>
  <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

JavaScript (app.js):

```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  var map = L.map("map").setView([51.505, -0.09], 13); // Set the initial coordinates and zoom level

  L.tileLayer("https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png", {
    attribution: '&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
  }).addTo(map);

  var marker = L.marker([51.505, -0.09]).addTo(map);
});

```

In this example, we first include the necessary Leaflet CSS and JavaScript files in the HTML head. We then create a div element with an id of "map" to hold the map. The JavaScript code initializes the map, sets the view, and adds the OSM tiles as the base layer. Finally, we add a marker at the specified coordinates.
